This project of mine is going to help your life become easy and you are going to feel like a king after controlling appliances in your house by just giving a command to Alexa.

The main thing behind this project is nothing but the functioning of two modules ESP8266 and Relay Module. Basically we are going to control our ESP8266 using Alexa.

Towards the end of the article, we will be doing simple connections between the ESP8266 and relay module followed by the code for connecting and controlling ESP8266 with Alexa.
